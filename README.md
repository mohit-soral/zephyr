# zephyr

*Zephyrus, sometimes known in English as just Zephyr, is the Greek god of the west wind. The gentlest of the winds, Zephyrus is known as the fructifying wind, the messenger of spring.*

## Setup and working

### First Basic setup

- The First Setup is like a hello world for setting up *zephyr*
- [Refer](documentation/Components-and-Connections.md) for connecting the components.
- Flash [code](arduino/deviceCode.ino) to the Arduino Board.

#### NOTE:
- Be careful with the setup since it deals with High Voltage Supply
- It is advices to connect the power supply only after all the connections are made.
- The deviceCode uses Digital Pin 7 to control the relay. In case you would like to use a different PIN, make the connections and update the code accordingly.
